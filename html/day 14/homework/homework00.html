<h1>My favorite hobbies and interests</h1>
<h2>hobbies</h2>
<p>One of my favorite activities is playing football. Not only to playng, everything 
    related to football attracts me and gives me great pleasure. This can be: watching 
    football games, quizzes about football, football training and more. Football is the
    greatest sport of all time with it's greatest athletes. Football is more than just 
    a game, it's a universal language that connects people worldwide. From the streets 
    to grand stadiums, it bridges cultures and fosters friendships. Regardless of background 
    or beliefs, the love for football unites us all in a shared passion for the beautiful game</p>
<h2>interests</h2>
<p>I am interested in web programming. I think that this is the profession of the future that 
    will be valued more than it is now and it will provide a success. And of course GOA helps me to study it.</p>
